# MultiUseBoard
The MUB - An ultra-compact, modular processing unit

## What is it?
A tiny, modular, all-in-one processing board. On it's own, it can't do much. But this board can be integrated into just about any other board. All of the mcu pins and power lines are accessible through the low-profile connectors, providing the maximum mcu potential for any project.

## So what makes this better than an Arduino/Blue Pill/Feather?
Well, a few reasons...
- Super compact 32mm x 23mm size
- Powerful Cortex M4 120MHz mcu
- Access to EVERY SINGLE PIN (41 total GPIO)
- Super tiny and low profile board-board connectors
- Onboard 5v and 3v3 regulators (Supports up to 32V input)
- $10 BOM cost at qty 1, $7 at qty 10
- Broken out programming header for easy access

## Cool, I want one!
Great! Then build it yourself :) I hope to sell these boards once the global chip shortage resolves itself, but for now you are on your own!

The gerber files to order the board are found in this repo. Order at your own risk.

A probably up-to-date BOM can be found [here](https://octopart.com/bom-tool/H8oUqADt)

A custom package for kicad exists in the libraries folder, so you can easily integrate the mounting footprint into your own board and simply connect a MUB in the slot.

Godspeed.
